          <h2>The Ministry of Energy, Mines, and Petroleum Resources (EMPR)</h2>
          <p>The Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources seeks to achieve voluntary compliance with applicable requirements wherever possible.  This is generally achieved through the issuance of orders to remedy non-compliance.  Where voluntary compliance cannot be achieved or where the non-compliance presents more significant risks, the Ministry may pursue the imposition of an administrative monetary penalty (AMP) or an offence prosecution.</p>
          <p>The AMP program allows the Ministry to impose a financial penalty on any individual or corporation that contravenes prescribed provisions of the Mines Act, the regulations and/or the Health, Safety and Reclamation Code. AMPs provide an additional compliance and enforcement tool that is efficient, cost-effective and flexible, and can be imposed without court involvement. While AMPs are relatively new to EMPR, they are widely used by other ministries in the natural resource sector.</p>
          <p>Where a person contravenes a provision of the Mines Act, the regulations, the Health, Safety and Reclamation Code or an order, and where the evidence is supportive, charges may be recommended for approval by Crown Counsel. A person convicted of an offence under the Mines Act is liable to a fine of not more than $1,000,000 or to imprisonment for not more than three years or both.</p>

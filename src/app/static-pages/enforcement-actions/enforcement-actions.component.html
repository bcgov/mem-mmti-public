      <h2>The Ministry of Energy, Mines, and Low Carbon Innovation (EMLI)</h2>
      <p>The Ministry of Energy, Mines, and Low Carbon Innovation seeks to achieve voluntary compliance with applicable
        requirements wherever possible. This is generally achieved through the issuance of orders to remedy
        non-compliance. Where voluntary compliance cannot be achieved or where the non-compliance presents more
        significant risks, the Ministry may pursue the imposition of an administrative monetary penalty (AMP) or an
        offence prosecution.</p>
      <p>The AMP program allows the Ministry to impose a financial penalty on any individual or corporation that
        contravenes prescribed provisions of the Mines Act, the regulations and/or the Health, Safety and Reclamation
        Code. AMPs provide an additional compliance and enforcement tool that is efficient, cost-effective and flexible,
        and can be imposed without court involvement. AMPs were introduced under the Mines Act in 2017.</p>
      <p>Where a person contravenes a provision of the Mines Act, the regulations, the Health, Safety and Reclamation
        Code or an order, and where the evidence is supportive, charges may be recommended for approval by Crown
        Counsel. A person convicted of an offence under the Mines Act is liable to a fine of not more than $1,000,000 or
        to imprisonment for not more than three years or both.</p>

        <li>
          R. v. Green Mountain Jade Inc.: In September 2019, the Court delivered a decision regarding sentencing and
          delivered Green Mountain Jade Inc. a fine of $20,000 and took into account a $50,000 donation the accused
          had made to the deceased’s family.
          <br />
          On July 20, 2015, an excavator operator was conducting trenching activities. During these activities, his
          excavator became stuck on the steep slope in that area. After unsuccessful attempts to free the excavator,
          he lost control of the machine while operating it down the slope. The excavator rolled, and the operator was
          ejected and sustained serious injuries. He was air-lifted to the Dease Lake Medical Center where he
          succumbed to his injuries shortly after arrival.

          R. v. Anthony Barry (Big Nugget): On March 13, 2020 counsel for Anthony Barry entered a guilty plea in
          relation to an offence under section 37(2) of the Mines Act stemming from a contravention of part 1.11.1 of
          the Health, Safety and Reclamation Code for Mines in B.C.  Barry failed to ensure that all employees receive
          thorough orientation and basic instruction in safe work practices.  The Court imposed a fine of $7,500 after
          taking into account other payments the accused made to the family of the injured party.
          <br />
          On December 31, 2016, an underaged worker sustained a transitory head injury and a shoulder fracture as a
          result of being struck by a falling tree that was being felled by an excavator operated by the permittee and
          mine manager Anthony Barry.

# BDDStack

## Description

This is an example of incorporating Geb into a Gradle build. It shows the use of Spock and JUnit 4 tests.

The build is setup to work with a variety of browsers and we aim to add as many as possible.
A JenkinsSlave image has been created that can run Chrome/Firefox Headless tests. This offers a viable option for replacing phantomJs in the OpenShift pipeline. Please see the [JenkinsSlave Dockerfile][dockerfile] setup.
This repository also holds a Dockerfile for a CentOS based image that will run headless tests as well.

BDDStack is 100% compatible with the tests that were created in the previous incarnation of the framework called [NavUnit][navunit] (which is now deprecated). Please see the wiki for instructions on how to use your NavUnit Tests in BDDStack.

## Usage

The following commands will launch the tests with the individual browsers:

    ./gradlew chromeTest
    ./gradlew chromeHeadlessTest //Will run in pipeline as well
    ./gradlew remoteChrome
    ./gradlew remoteFirefox
    ./gradlew remoteEdge
    ./gradlew remoteIe      // not passing, possible test changes required
    ./gradlew remoteSafari // current drivers don't work well, test changes required
    
To run with all, you can run:

    ./gradlew test

Replace `./gradlew` with `gradlew.bat` in the above examples if you're on Windows.
